# ProjectileMotion-w-Bezier-Curves

A simple projectile motion simulator assuming an initial velocity of 10 units per second. Modeled using Bezier curves (a type of parametric curve employing interpolation) as opposed to points. Quadratic Bezier curves can be  rendered such that they are parabolas, making them useful for this visualization. All resistive forces are ignored.
